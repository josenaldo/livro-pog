# Prompt templates

Put reusable prompt templates for this repository here.

Recommended naming: `*.prompt.md`.

These prompts should assume the repo conventions:
- Skills are in `.github/skills/`.
- Rules/instructions are in `.github/instructions/`.
- Content lives in `content/` and schema in `contentlayer.config.js`.
